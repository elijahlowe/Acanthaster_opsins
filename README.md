[Acantaster](http://marinegenomics.oist.jp/cots/viewer/download?project_id=46) is sea star with eyes located on the terminal tubefeet. In efforts to study the development of vision and light sensing we sequenced several tissue specific samples (w/ 3 replicates each) for differential expression (DE) analysis using Illimina sequencers.

The raw data for the reads has been uploaded to NCBI under the accession number TBD. Scripts used for this analysis are located in the scripts folder.

To do this analysis several different software packages were used:
BLAST to identify and annotate the genes of interest.
MAFFT v7.215 to align the opsin sequences, and trimal to gap regions in the alignments
FastTree to construct phylogenomic trees to identify the specific opsin paralogues

Salmon for gene quantificantion
